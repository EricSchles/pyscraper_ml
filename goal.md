The of this project is a simple one - to provide a scrapable set of data for a secondary project:

The grand unified theory of problems:

The grand unified theory of problems is a set of equations, a system if you will, of equations of every major and minor problem at defined geographic levels of granularity.  Fidelty will be very hard to reproduce as granularity increases.  Instead, the goal is provide fidelty to as close an approximation as possible.  The intention behind this project is a global, national and local monitor of the world's problems with coefficients indicating how a given problem relates and interoperates with other problems.  I believe this project could be funded by a series of local governments and possibly some national grants.  The goal of that project is a simple one:

How can we improve things, with a minimal number of actions?

By understanding how each model is affected by other parts of the system, we can predict the next step in our equation, and move certain coefficients down or up.  If we know how different parts of our system effect other parts, then we can do the most good with the least amount of effort.

Eventually, the coefficients will become precise.  At that time, this system can inform real policy changes.

How to observe the coefficients?

1. Scraping - that is the goal of this project - pyscraper_ml
2. Surveys - for that I will run my own surveys and polls as well as use the surveys of others, assuming they ask the right questions.
3. Actions - this is related to scraping but will require direct intervention and understanding.

I believe this project can bring us to a brighter, more sustainable, more equitable future for all.  One for all.  One system of equations for every living thing.  That is the goal of this project.
